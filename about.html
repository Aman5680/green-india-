<p><b>Clean India and Green India are national programmes aimed at improving the country. In 2014, a campaign called "Clean India" was started—Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan or the Clean India Movement were the other names for this campaign. The programme was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi by cleaning the streets. With numerous people taking part, this campaign was the biggest one ever. Garbage poses a serious danger to a country's growth and it is also a major threat to success in the modern economy. Industrialization and commercialization have only served to aggravate this issue. Therefore, as responsible citizens of this country, it is our responsibility and duty to do everything to keep our environment clean and green.</b><br><br>

<h1>Our Commitment</h1>
</center>
<li> <u> Plastic is one of the main causes of environmental degradation, so it is crucial that we stop using it and replace it with materials based on wood in our houses. To lessen the impact of plastic on the environment, we must also &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use jute or paper bags rather than plastic ones.</li>

<li>We can always recycle and reuse objects to cut down on waste and pollution in the environment. For example, worn-out and discarded items can be utilised as décor and other things in homes and workplaces.</li>

<li>We can help save trees by printing on both sides of the page, utilising hand dryers in place of paper towels, and using reusable goods instead of toilet paper and throwaway towels. Additionally, we need to grow trees and other &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plants around our homes to maximise the amount of greenery there is.</li>

<li>We must utilise dustbins effectively if we are to achieve cleanliness. We should dispose of our trash in dustbins rather than on the roads and streets.</li>

<li>Awareness-raising campaigns must be performed in order to achieve community cleanliness and greenery. We must inform the public of the advantages of cleanliness and nature.</li>

<li>Since the Swachh Bharat Mission was established, many Indians have given cleanliness considerable consideration. People started doing daily cleanups of their surroundings and proper rubbish disposal. Additionally, Green &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India addresses the issue of climate change. The government wants to minimise greenhouse gases, which are the cause of climate change and global warming, by encouraging the growth of trees. In addition, the Indian &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government changed its energy and economic policies to be more environmentally friendly.</u></li>
